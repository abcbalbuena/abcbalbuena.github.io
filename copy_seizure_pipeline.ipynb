    "\n",
    "We have downloaded the NPY files from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5pc2j46cbc/1\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the files x_test.npy, x_train.npy, y_test.npy, y_train.npy. These files were obtained by preprocessing the raw EDF files (also provided in the dataset) using preprocessing.py (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5pc2j46cbc/1/files/56ef90d9-04bb-4d02-bff8-7472cc1e8cbb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code takes EEG data stored as 3D NumPy arrays and converts them into CSV files suitable for machine learning, applying two key preprocessing steps along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The X Input Data Structure (from the npy files) is a 3D NumPy array with shape (segments, channels, samples). Each segment represents a time window (like your 1-second windows). Each channel represents an EEG electrode/channel, Each sample represents a time point (500 samples in your case)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Y data is/are 1D NumPy array/s with labels for each segment\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Processing Steps\n",
    "1. Data Reshaping: The code \"flattens\" the 3D structure by treating each channel of each segment as a separate univariate time series. So if you have 10 segments with 19 channels each, you get 190 individual time series rows in the CSV. Although EEG channels capture signals from different scalp regions (e.g., frontal, temporal, occipital), each with unique noise profiles and physiological artifacts, we can treat the 19 channels as individual time series with the same dynamical properties (like signal complexity and nonlinearity) since these are consistent across channels for the same subject/task due to shared neural generators and volume conduction. Preprocessing parameters can be global because biological noise (e.g., muscle artifacts, eye blinks) affects all channels similarly, while seizures manifest as synchronized bursts across multiple channels, preserving embedding topology.\n",
    "2. Label Conversion: Converts multi-class labels (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) into binary labels (0 for non-seizure, 1 for seizure), where anything that wasn't originally 0 becomes 1.\n",
    "3. Baseline Correction: Subtracts the mean from each time series to center it around zero. The purpose is to remove any remaining DC offset or very slow drift within the 1-second epoch. This \"zeros\" the data.\n",
    "4. Per-Segment Z-score Normalization: Standardizes each time series to have mean=0 and standard deviation=1. The purpose is to ensure each 1-second segment has a similar dynamic range or distribution. This is crucial for many ML algorithms and feature extraction methods that are sensitive to feature scales (e.g., TDA persistence image generation if it involves distance calculations, KNN). This step effectively standardizes each 1-second window independently. The script that transformed the raw EDF data intoNPY files did group-wise max-abs scaling. When you combine these groups, the absolute values might still differ significantly. Scaling each 1-second segment individually ensures they are all on a comparable footing before feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following list gives reasons why Baseline Correction (mean subtraction) is often recommended as a separate step even if Z-score Normalization is done after:\n",
    "1. Conceptual Clarity & Order of Operations: The idea is often to first remove any overall offset (center the signal around zero) to represent pure AC fluctuations. Also, denoising algorithms (like the wavelet denoising I suggested) might behave more predictably or effectively on data that is already zero-mean as the characteristics of noise might be more easily separable from a signal that doesn't have a large DC component. Lastly, normalization/scaling is then applied to the cleaned, centered signal to bring different epochs/channels to a comparable dynamic range for the ML model.\n",
    "2. Interpretation of Features (if extracted before final scaling):\n",
    "If you were to extract certain features (e.g., variance, power) from the signal after baseline correction but before Z-score scaling, these features would be calculated on zero-mean data. Power, for example, is directly affected by a DC offset. Removing the offset ensures you're calculating the power of the fluctuations. While Z-scoring also removes the mean, if features are extracted at an intermediate stage, the initial baseline correction is beneficial.\n",
    "3. Historical Practice & Robustness:\n",
    "Baseline correction is a very standard step in EEG processing, especially for Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), where a pre-stimulus baseline is used. For continuous data segmented into epochs, subtracting the epoch's own mean is the analogous step. It's often done as a foundational \"hygiene\" step.\n",
    "4. Flexibility in Normalization Choice:\n",
    "If you perform baseline correction (mean subtraction) first, you have a centered signal. You can then decide to apply Z-score, Min-Max, or another scaling method without worrying about the centering aspect again.\n",

    "**Interpretation for Test 2:**\n",
    "We do *not* have evidence that the average H1 bottleneck distance between Seizure and Normal diagrams is greater than the average H1 bottleneck distance among Normal diagrams themselves. In fact, the sample data suggests the opposite: the Normal diagrams are, on average, slightly *more* spread out (larger mean internal distance `μ_W0 = 0.569`) than the distance separating them from Seizure diagrams (`μ_B = 0.559`).\n",
    "*   This is a **less positive finding for separability from the perspective of the \"Normal\" class.** It implies that the \"Normal\" class might be more topologically diverse internally than the \"Seizure\" class, and this diversity is comparable to, or even slightly exceeds, its average distance to the \"Seizure\" class.\n",
    "*   The Normal diagrams do not form as tight a topological cluster relative to the Seizure diagrams as the Seizure diagrams do relative to the Normal ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Conclusion from Bottleneck Distance Statistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Seizure Class Cohesion:** The Seizure class (Class 1) appears to be relatively topologically cohesive in H1 (compared to its distance to the Normal class). The average internal distance within the Seizure class is significantly smaller than its average distance to the Normal class. This is good for identifying seizures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Normal Class Dispersion:** The Normal class (Class 0) appears to be more topologically diverse in H1. Its average internal distance is slightly larger than its average distance to the Seizure class. This means that while Seizure diagrams might look distinct from Normal diagrams on average, some Normal diagrams might be topologically quite far from other Normal diagrams, potentially encroaching on the \"space\" of Seizure diagrams if we were to use these distances directly for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for Classification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A classifier might find it easier to learn a boundary that separates \"Seizure\" from \"Not Seizure\" because the Seizure class is relatively more compact and distinct from Normal in one direction of comparison.\n",
    "*   However, the higher internal diversity of the Normal class could lead to some Normal samples being misclassified as Seizures if their topology happens to be unusual for a Normal state but closer to the Seizure cluster's average topology.\n",
    "*   The overall separability is not perfectly symmetric. The \"gap\" between the classes is clearer when viewed from the perspective of the Seizure class's internal consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This nuanced understanding is valuable. While not perfect, the significant result from Test 1 is promising for the utility of these H1 TDA features. The result from Test 2 highlights that the \"Normal\" EEG state might have a broader range of topological expressions, which is plausible given the many non-seizure brain activities that could fall under \"Normal.\""
